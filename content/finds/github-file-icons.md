Icons really set the vibe. Compare these two screenshots:

![GitHub File Icons](/images/github-with-icons.png)

Which one of these passes the vibe check?

You can make your GitHub experience look like the latter with the [File Icons for GitHub & GitLab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/file-icons-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe) Chrome extension.
