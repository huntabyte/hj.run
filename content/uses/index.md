## Hardware

### Desktop Equipment

- [Apple Mac Studio (M2 Max)](https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/) - I swore up and down that I'd never be a Mac user, but here we are. This thing is a beast and I have to try to make it sweat.
- [Bose 700 Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9MJKBV?th=1) - When I need to focus and block out the world, these are my go-to. They are a game-changer on flights, too. I've been thinking of upgrading to the newest QuietComfort Ultras, but I can't justify it yet.
- [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Graphite/dp/B09HM94VDS/) - I can't imagine using a mouse that isn't this one. It's the perfect blend of ergonomics and functionality. I especially love the programmable side buttons, which I map to switch between desktops (forward and back) and show all windows (bottom button).
- [Logitech MX Keys S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKW3LB2B/) - I was once a clickity clackity mechanical keyboard user, but I've since switched to this keyboard. It's quiet, has a great feel, and the battery lasts forever. The ability to switch between 3 devices is super handy, too.

### Recording/Streaming Equipment

- [Sony ZV E-10](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Alpha-ZV-E10-Interchangeable-Mirrorless/dp/B09BBLH4SG) - By no means am I a professional videographer/photographer, but from my research this is a great camera for the price. It's been great for recording videos and streaming, though I would recommend grabbing a lens with it.
- [Sigma 16mm f/1.4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077BWD2BB/) - Speaking of lenses, this is the one I use. Switching from the default to this lens was a night and day difference. It's a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it.
- [Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-Recording/dp/B07K3FN5MR/) - This is what I use to connect my camera to my computer for streaming/recording.
- [Elgato Key Light](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Key-Light-Professional-app-adjustable/dp/B07L755X9G/) (x2) - I have no clue what I'm doing with lights and unsure if I'm even using these correctly, but they make my setup look more sophisticated.
- [Shure SM7B](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M/) - The mic that every content creator and their mother uses. It's a great mic, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't tell the difference between this and a cheaper mic.
- [Vocaster One](https://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-Vocaster-One-Podcasting-Lightweight/dp/B09ZGS2B2M) - Prior to switching to Mac, I used a GoXLR Mini. GoXLR doesn't support Mac, so I had to switch to something else and chose this. It's simple and limited, but gets the job done for my needs.
- [Elgato Stream Deck MK.2](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-MK-2-Controller/dp/B09738CV2G) - I really only use this for streaming. I have a few buttons that switch scenes, mute my mic, and blur my screen. It's a bit overkill for my needs, but I like it.

### Travel Equipment

- [Apple MacBook Air (M2) 13-inch](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) - I wasn't sure if the Macbook Air would be powerful enough for my needs, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a great laptop and I love the form factor, especially for travel. I have no issues running VSCode, Figma, and a few other apps at the same time.
- [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) - I'm not 100% sold on the comfort of these, but they are nice for travel and when I'm working in public places.
- [Tumi Compact Laptop Brief Pack](https://www.tumi.com/p/compact-laptop-brief-pack-01172971041/) - I'd never spend this much on a backpack, but I got it as a gift and I love it. It has so many pockets and compartments making it perfect for travel. It's also very comfortable to wear.

## Software

### General Productivity

- [Arc](https://arc.net/) - Arc has been a joy to use. It's a Chromium-based browser that adds a bunch of productivity features and keyboard shortcuts. I love the workspaces, tabs, and have minimal complaints.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) - It took me way too long to start using a password manager. Now that I have, I can't imagine not using one. 1Password is great. My fianc√© and I have a shared vault for all our shared accounts and obligations, which is clutch.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Time and time again I've tried Notion, but my ADHD brain can't handle it. I spend too much time trying to make things look pretty and not enough time actually using it. Obsidian is the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity for me.
- [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) - Could not imagine using my Mac without Raycast. It's a launcher, but so much more. I use it to quickly open apps, calculate, clipboard history, and more. It's a must-have.
- **Browser Extensions**:
  - [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github) - I use this to make GitHub better. It adds a bunch of features and tweaks that I can't live without. Sometimes when I'm on a browser without this extension, I think GitHub is broken.
  - [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) - I use this to make sites that are too bright easier on my eyes.
  - [File Icons for GitHub & GitLab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/file-icons-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe) - I only recently discovered this extension and I love it. It adds file icons to GitHub and GitLab replacing the generic file icons.
  - [CLS Visualizer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cls-visualizer/jbbeihojggidiclbcneckhcblilapahn) - I use this to check the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) of the sites/apps I'm working on.

### VSCode Setup

- **Theme**: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) - I've been using this theme for years now and love that the highlighting on GitHub matches my editor.
- **Font**: [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) - I've been using Cascadia Code for years as well. I don't use ligatures, but I've grown to love the font and immediately notice when I'm on a computer that doesn't have it.
- **Icon Theme**: [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) - This icon theme is simple and clean.
- **Extensions**: Of course I use the more common TypeScript, Svelte, Prettier, ESLint, etc. But here are some of the more interesting ones:
  - [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) - The most asked about extension I use. It highlights errors and warnings inline with the code. I love that I don't have to hover over the squiggly line to see what's wrong. It also makes me feel like I need to fix the issues right away when half my screen is red/yellow.
  - [vscode-pdf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf) - I use this to preview PDFs in VSCode. It's nice to not have to switch to another app to view a PDF.
  - [advanced-new-file](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patbenatar.advanced-new-file) - This extension makes it faster to create new files anywhere in the project. I remapped `cmd+n` to open this instead of the default new file dialog (which sucks).
  - [Batch Rename](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JannisX11.batch-rename-extension) - I use this to rename files in bulk. I don't use it often, but when I do, I'm glad I have it.
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - I don't do any of the chat or fancy stuff with Copilot. I strictly use it to do monotinous, repetitive tasks that require no thought. It's great for that.

### Development

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - This terminal lets me do all the things I need to do.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - This with the [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme/blob/master/tokyo-night.itermcolors) theme makes me happy.

### Design

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - I use Figma for just about everything design-related - thumbnails, logos, wireframes, mockups, etc.

### Video/Streaming

- [Screen Flow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) - I use ScreenFlow for recording and editing my screencasts. It's pretty simple and limited, but it doesn't get in my way and enables me to get things done quickly.
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) - I use OBS for streaming and as a virtual camera for work meetings.
