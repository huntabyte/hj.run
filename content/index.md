I've been working professionally in tech for almost 10 years and have been passionate about it for as long as I can remember.

I really enjoy building and maintaining open source projects for the Svelte ecosystem.

Some of the more notable projects I've built or helped build and maintain are:

- [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com)
- [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com)
- [Formsnap](https://formsnap.dev)
- [PaneForge](https://paneforge.com)
- [Runed](https://runed.dev)
- [Melt UI](https://melt-ui.com)

I also gain fulfillment in sharing what I learn with others, mostly in the form of [video content](https://youtube.com/@huntabyte). I'm hoping that having this site will encourage me to share more [written](/articles) content as well.

When I'm not doing things on the internet, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful fianc√© and our two dogs. We love trying out new breakfast spots, especially if they have good brew.
