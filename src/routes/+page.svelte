	<h1 class="not-prose text-2xl font-medium text-stone-950">I'm Hunter, aka Huntabyte.</h1>
	<p>
		I've been working professionally in tech for almost 10 years and have been passionate about it
		for as long as I can remember.
	</p>
	<p>I really enjoy building and maintaining open source projects for the Svelte ecosystem.</p>
	<p>Some of the more notable projects I've built or helped build and maintain are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://shadcn-svelte.com" target="_blank"> shadcn-svelte </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://melt-ui.com" target="_blank"> Melt UI </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://bits-ui.com" target="_blank"> Bits UI </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://formsnap.dev" target="_blank"> Formsnap </a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://paneforge.com" target="_blank"> PaneForge </a>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I also gain fulfillment in sharing what I learn with others, mostly in the form of <a
			href="https://youtube.com/@huntabyte"
			target="_blank"
		>
			video content
		</a>
		. I'm hoping that having this site will encourage me to share more
		<a href="/articles">written</a> content as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not doing things on the internet, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful fianc√©e and
		our two dogs. We love trying out new breakfast spots, especially if they have good brew
		(coffee).
